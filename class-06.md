# Class 6

* ## Java OO
* * Object<br/>
 means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts<br/>
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.<br/>
An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.<br/>
* * Class<br/>
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.<br/>
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.

* ## Java Inheritance & Interfaces
* * Inheritance<br/>
Java inheritance refers to the ability in Java for one class to inherit from another class. In Java this is also called extending a class. One class can extend another class and thereby inherit from that class.<br/>
When one class inherits from another class in Java, the two classes take on certain roles. The class that extends (inherits from another class) is the subclass and the class that is being extended (the class being inherited from) is the superclass . In other words, the subclass extends the superclass. Or, the subclass inherits from the superclass.<br/>
Another commonly used term for inheritance is specialization and generalization. A subclass is a specialization of a superclass, and a superclass is a generalization of one or more subclasses.<br>
nheritance can be an effective method to share code between classes that have some traits in common, yet allowing the classes to have somea parts that are different.

* * Interfaces<br/>
Interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.<br/>
Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods<br>
Writing an interface is similar to writing a class. But a class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. And an interface contains behaviors that a class implements.<br/>
Unless the class that implements the interface is abstract, all the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class.
