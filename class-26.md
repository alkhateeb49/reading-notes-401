### What is Android?<br>
Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK, an Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.<br/>
Android Developer Fundamentals is a training course created by the Google Developer Training team. You learn basic Android programming concepts and build a variety of apps, starting with Hello World and working your way up to apps that use content providers and loaders.<br/>
Android App is a software designed to run on an Android device or emulator. The term also refers to an APK file which stands for Android package. This file is a Zip archive containing app code, resources, and meta information.<br/>
Android apps can be written in Kotlin, Java, and C++ and are run inside Virtual Machine. The official development environment is Android Studio.<br/>
An Android app is a software application running on the Android platform. Because the Android platform is built for mobile devices, a typical Android app is designed for a smartphone or a tablet PC running on the Android OS.<br/>


## Fundamentals and Info:
- Android apps are typically written using Kotlin, Java, or C++ languages.
- The Android SDK tools compile code and additional resource files into an Android Package file (APK).
- The Android OS is a multi-user Linux system where each app is its own user.
- Each process has its own VM, so code from each app is run in isolation.
- Apps can work with/access other apps, but the permission has to be explicitly given by the user.

## Core Components
- Activities: the entry point for interacting with the user
- Services: a general purpose entry point for keeping the app running in the background
- Broadcast Receivers: a component that allows the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular flow
- Content Providers: manages a set of app data that you can store in the file system or any persistent data storage location
