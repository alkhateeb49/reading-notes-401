## SNS: Getting Started

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

The A2A pub/sub functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Using Amazon SNS topics, your publisher systems can fanout messages to a large number of subscriber systems including Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions and HTTPS endpoints, for parallel processing, and Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. The A2P functionality enables you to send messages to users at scale via SMS, mobile push, and email.<br>

### *Benefits*
- - Modernize and decouple your applications.
- - Send messages directly to millions of users.
- - Reliably deliver messages.
- - Automatically scale your workload.
- - Ensure accuracy with message ordering and deduplication.
- - Simplify your architecture with Message Filtering.
