## Location

A data class representing a geographic location.

A location may consist of a latitude, longitude, timestamp, and other information such as bearing, altitude and velocity.

All locations generated through `LocationManager` are guaranteed to have a valid latitude, longitude, and timestamp . All other parameters are optional.

One of the unique features of mobile applications is location awareness. Mobile users take their devices with them everywhere, and adding location awareness to your app offers users a more contextual experience. The location APIs available in Google Play services facilitate adding location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, and activity recognition.
