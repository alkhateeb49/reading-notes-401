### What is a graph? 
In math, a graph can be defined as a pictorial representation or a diagram that represents  or values in an organized manner.

The points on the graph often represent the relationship between two or more things.<br/>

Here, for instance, we can represent the data given below, the type and number of school supplies used by students in a class, on a graph. We begin by counting each supply and representing the data in particular colors in a systematic order in a table.
