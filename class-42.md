## Ethics in the workplace
### *Google and AI*
Google is committing to not using artificial intelligence for weapons or surveillance after employees protested the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage. The AI principles represent a reversal for Google, which initially defended its involvement in Project Maven by noting that the project relied on open-source software that was not being used for explicitly offensive purposes. «While Google’s statement rejects building AI systems for information gathering and surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms, we are concerned about this qualification,» said Peter Asaro, a professor at The New School and one of the authors of an open letter that calls on Google to cancel its Maven contract.

## Ethics in Technology
### *Cyber-Security of self driving cars*
Experts say that self-driving cars will be particularly susceptible to hackers. I am not a car expert, but clearly, the less security vulnerabilities you have in your software, the less vulnerable you become to hacker attacks. Last fall, the Department of Transportation released guidelines for the development of self-driving cars and made cybersecurity part of a 15-point safety assessment of autonomous vehicles. I am not sure the security problem can solely be solved by regulation.

Rather, I think the government could check if car manufacturers are adhering to some predefined secure coding practices while ensuring they have taken some basic security precautions. The security market is hot today, so it is not surprising to see startups raising money to address the secure car problem.

### *Google AI Principles*
At its heart, AI is computer programming that learns and adapts. It can’t solve every problem, but its potential to improve our lives is profound. At Google, we use AI to make products more useful—from email that’s spam-free and easier to compose, to a digital assistant you can speak to naturally, to photos that pop the fun stuff out for you to enjoy.
Farmers are using it to monitor the health of their herds. Doctors are starting to use AI to help diagnose cancer and prevent blindness. These clear benefits are why Google invests heavily in AI research and development, and makes AI technologies widely available to others via our tools and open-source code.
As a leader in AI, we feel a deep responsibility to get this right. So today, we’re announcing seven principles to guide our work going forward. These are not theoretical concepts; they are concrete standards that will actively govern our research and product development and will impact our business decisions.
