# Serverless and Amplify

## Serverless Architecture
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity.

## Amplify
The Amplify Framework consists of 3 components including libraries, UI components, and a CLI toolchain. Components can be used together or on their own. Organized by use case, Amplify Libraries and UI components are powered by AWS services. They are open source and work with your existing front-end frameworks (React, React Native, Angular, Vue, Ionic) and iOS/Android IDEs. The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a toolchain to create and maintain serverless backends on AWS. Configure cloud functionality by following a simple, interactive workflow for specifying app capabilities, including the data model and auth requirements.

## GraphQL
The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your applicationâ€™s data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model.
