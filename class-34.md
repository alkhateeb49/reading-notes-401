## Android Monetization
This process involves multiple strategies. Some categories of apps are more suited to specific app monetization models than others. Some apps focus on one particular area of app monetization, and others incorporate multiple aspects.<br>

As a developer, you’ll need to generate revenue from your app. In the app economy, it can be challenging to stay afloat. Unless you have secured a nice amount of funding, it’s essential to read the advice in this post.

By using alternative methods to make money rather than charging for the app download itself, marketers can provide a better experience for their app users, particularly those who do not want to commit to paying for a product which they know little about. Equally, app monetization provides an ROI for app developers. Investors and affiliate partners will also reap the rewards of their investment into the app.

Sell goods or services through your app
When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments: Google Play's billing system and Google Pay.

Use Google Pay to sell physical goods or services that are used or delivered outside of your app. Google Pay provides your customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted. Accepting Google Pay speeds up your checkout process, as users won't need to enter their payment details each time or when they first download your app.
