# Espresso

## What is it?
- The core API is small, predictable, and easy to learn and yet remains open for customization. Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.
- Espresso tests run optimally fast! It lets you leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while it manipulates and asserts on the application UI when it is at rest.
- Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part of the development lifecycle. While it can be used for black-box testing, Espressoâ€™s full power is unlocked by those who are familiar with the codebase under test.

## Recording Tests
Espresso test recording is extremely powerful. This feature allows the user to simply interact with the GUI of whatever application that are working with and Espresso will keep track of what you do and convert it into code. This not only streamlines the process, but removes a lot of the margin for errors and mistakes. It similarly acts as an inviting example to learn and demonstrate testing considering testing is not always something developers think fondly of.
