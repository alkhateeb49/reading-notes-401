# Class 4

* ## Java Object-Oriented
### What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

### What are Classes and Objects?
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

* ## Java Classes

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.

* ## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

In mathematics, a base or a radix is the number of different digits or combination of digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers.

* * Binary

With binary, we have only two digits to represent a number, 0 and 1 and we are already out of symbols. So what do we do? Let’s apply the same rules that we used on the decimal system.

We make the right digit `0` and add `1` to left, that is, our next number is ‘10’. Then we go up until we used up all our symbols on the right side.So the next number in line is `11`.


* * Decimal

In mathematics, positional numeral system employing 10 as the base and requiring 10 different numerals, the digits `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.` It also requires a dot (decimal point) to represent decimal fractions. In this scheme, the numerals used in denoting a number take different place values depending upon position.

* * Hexadecimal

In mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or hex) numeral system is a positional numeral system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of 16. Unlike the common way of representing numbers using 10 symbols, hexadecimal uses 16 distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values `0 to 9`, and `"A"–"F"` (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values 10 to 15.

Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble), which is half a byte. For example, a single byte can have values ranging from `00000000` to `11111111` in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.
